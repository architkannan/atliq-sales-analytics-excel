##  üìù Overview

AtliQ Hardwares operates in diverse global markets, with multiple products, divisions, and distributors. 

However, challenges like inconsistent sales performance, unmet targets, and opaque profitability require in-depth analysis to inform decision-making and strategic planning. 

This project solves these challenges through two sub-projects:

1. **[Sales Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Sales%20Analytics%20Reports%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Focusing on customer and market performance over three years (2019 - 2021).
2. **[Finance Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/atliq-sales-analytics-excel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Finance%20Analytics%20Report%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Breaking down profitability and financial performance using Profit & Loss (P&L) reports for these 3 years. 


**NOTE:** AtliQ Hardwares follows a fiscal cycle from September through August (Sep - Aug).
