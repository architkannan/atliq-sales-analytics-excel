# Data-Driven Insights with Microsoft Excel: AtliQ Hardwares Analytics Project

The **AtliQ Hardwares Data Analytics Project** presents two cornerstone reports of data-driven decision-making: **Sales Analytics** and **Finance Analytics**. By utilizing advanced functionalities of **Microsoft Excel** — such as Power Query, Power Pivot, and DAX - this analysis uncovers insights to guide performance improvements, streamline operations, and enable strategic decisions for AtliQ Hardwares, a fictional global hardware manufacturer.

## Overview

AtliQ Hardwares operates in diverse global markets, with multiple products, divisions, and distributors. 

However, challenges like inconsistent sales performance, unmet targets, and opaque profitability require in-depth analysis to inform decision-making and strategic planning. 

This project solves these challenges through two sub-projects:

1. **[Sales Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Sales%20Analytics%20Reports%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Focusing on customer and market performance over three years (2019–2021).
2. **[Finance Analytics](https://github.com/archietk/atliq-sales-analytics-excel/blob/main/Consolidated%20Finance%20Analytics%20Report%20-%20AtliQ%20Hardwares.pdf)**: Breaking down profitability and financial performance using Profit & Loss (P&L) reports for these 3 years. 


**NOTE:** AtliQ Hardwares follows a fiscal cycle from September through August (Sep - Aug).

## Sales Analytics: Understanding Performance and Trends

### **Project Objective**
1. Create a **[Customer Performance Report](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Customer%20Performance.pdf)** for global distributors.
2. Generate a **[Market Performance Report](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Market%20Performance%20vs%20Target.pdf)** for all operating countries.
3. Create intuitive visualizations to compare 2021 actual sales against targets.

### **North Star Metrics**
*   **Net Sales Growth (Year-over-Year):** This metric measures the overall growth of sales revenue from one year to the next across products, divisions, and markets. It is a critical indicator of AtliQ Hardwares' ability to expand its customer base and increase revenue.
*   **Sales Targets vs Actual Sales:** To measure how efficient the company's sales were compared to business targets.
*   **Top 5 Performing Markets by Net Sales:** This metric identifies the markets that are contributing the most to revenue. This helps inform marketing and expansion strategies.
*   **Customer Performance:** Analysis of customer performance metrics, based on volume of sales can lead to better resource allocation to those customers.
*   **Top 5 & Bottom 5 Products by Volume of Sales:** Identifying top and bottom-performing products by quantity is crucial to making strategic decisions about product focus, marketing, and inventory management.

### **Questions Answered**
The analysis addresses critical business questions such as:
- **[Top-performing products](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Top%2010%20Products%20by%20Growth.pdf)**: Which 10 products saw the highest net sales growth from 2020 to 2021?
- **[Division trends](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Division%20Performance.pdf)**: What are the growth trends across business divisions for 2020 and 2021?
- **[Product rankings](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Top%20Bottom%20Product%20by%20Quantity.pdf)**: Which products are in the top 5 and bottom 5 by quantity sold?
- **[New product launches](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/New%20Products%20Sold%20in%202021.pdf)**: What products were introduced in 2021?
- **[Market leaders](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Top%205%20Countries%20Sales%202021.pdf)**: Which 5 countries achieved the highest net sales in 2021?

## Finance Analytics: Building Comprehensive Profitability Insights

### **Project Objective**
1. Create detailed **[Profit & Loss Statements by Fiscal Year](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/P%26L%20Report%20by%20Fiscal%20Year.pdf)**, **[Month](https://github.com/archietk/atliq-sales-analytics-excel/blob/main/P%26L%20Report%20by%20Fiscal%20Month.pdf)**, **[Market](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/P%26L%20Report%20by%20Markets.pdf)**, and **[Zone](https://github.com/archietk/SalesAnalyticsExcel/blob/main/Quarterly%20GM%20by%20Sub%20Zones.pdf)**.
2. Derive key profitability metrics, including **Gross Margin** and **Gross Margin %**.

### **North Star Metrics**
*   **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) per Unit**: Analyzing the cost incurred to manufacture one unit of a product can drive greater operational efficiency and profitability.
*   **Gross Profit Margin:** This metric measures the profitability of AtliQ's core operations after accounting for the cost of goods sold. A higher gross profit margin indicates efficient production and pricing strategies.
*   **Profit & Loss (P&L) by Month and Year:** Tracking the company’s P&L on a monthly and yearly basis enables the identification of key trends and anomalies in financial performance.
*   **Profit & Loss (P&L) by Market and Zone:** These P&L reports for different markets/ zones will reveal profitability performance for each region.

### **Role of Reports**
P&L reports serve as a cornerstone for:
- Supporting informed decision-making.
- Building confidence in the financial health of the business.
- Forecasting and budgeting with precision.
- Performance comparison across years and regions to identify growth opportunities and cost inefficiencies.
